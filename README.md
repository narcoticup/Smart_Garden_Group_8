- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, light, and rain
- Energy and water usage optimization
- Remote monitoring and control via Telegram bot
- Data visualization through ThingSpeak integration

## System Architecture
The system consists of several key components:
1. Central Processing Unit (Raspberry Pi)
2. Device Connector (Arduino Nano)
3. Home Catalog
4. MQTT Broker
5. ThingSpeak Adaptor
6. Telegram Bot

## Technologies Used
